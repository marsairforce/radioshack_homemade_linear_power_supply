# A dual rail power supply for use in op-amp circuits

It keeps coming up where I need to get a good dual rail op-amp power supply in projects.

Wanting to design a power supply module that is economical and small form factor and general purpose enough to be put into various applications as needed.

## Requirements

* Input from 120VAC
* IEC power connector, fuze. Optional switch.
* +15V and -15V outputs. Perhaps up to 1A is all we would need.
* A +5V output for other logic circuits in the project.

## Nice to have

* Efficient. Not using linear regulators. It would be quite readily available to use a transformer, a 7815, 7915 regulators, capacitors. But transformers tend to be expensive.
* Small. Not using large bulky and expensive transformer.
* Low noise. Suitable for use in audio applications.

## Investigation

It turns out What I am looking for just exists as a module: https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/xp-power/ECL15UT03-E/1470-1185-ND/4487566 $80

Done.

No project to do at this time.
